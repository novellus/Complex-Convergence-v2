# complex_convergence.py
* Computes the behavior of a field of complex points under discrete iteration of a function
* indicates which points appear to converge or diverge under iteration, and what those convergence values are

# complex_convergence_single_point_plotter.py
* plots the discrete trajectory of a single complex point under iteration of a function
